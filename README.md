## HTML Structure Explanation
The website follows proper HTML5 document structure and uses semantic elements:

- <!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document as HTML5
- <html>: Root element of the webpage
- <head>: Contains metadata such as title and character encoding
- <body>: Contains all visible content

### Semantic Elements Used

- <nav>: Contains navigation links to different sections
- <main>: Wraps all the main content of the page
- <section>: Separates content into About, Skills/Projects, and Contact
- <article>: Groups related information inside sections
- <footer>: Displays footer information such as copyright

Contains 2–3 paragraphs describing who I am and my background.

### Skills / Projects Section
Displays my skills and/or projects using unordered or ordered lists.

### Contact Section

## Images
The website includes at least three images.
Each image uses the `alt` attribute to improve accessibility and usability.

## Accessibility and Best Practices
- Semantic HTML elements are used for better accessibility
- Images include alt text
- Proper heading hierarchy is followed (h1 to h3)

---

## Validation
